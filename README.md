For each presentation, copy-and-paste then fill-in-the-blanks.  You must comment on at least one thing. 



Title of presentation: Fragile Families (1)

What were aspects of the presentation that you liked: 
Detailed explanation of column names  helped for quick understading, and the "random" selection of columns chosen to use in analysis.

What were aspects of the presentations for which you had concerns or questions: 
More "visual" examples of possibly when you were choosing, cleaning, or analyzing data.





Title of presentation: Mass Shooting (2)

What were aspects of the presentation that you liked: 
Great plots and visuals. The ordering of explanation and data information before stating your goal/thesis was smart.

What were aspects of the presentations for which you had concerns or questions: 
I don't feel like there was a as much focus on the data revealing the correlation between mass shootings and firearm purchases, although you kept trying to relate your points to it.





Title of presentation: Voting (3)

What were aspects of the presentation that you liked: 
Thought about a lot of reasons in errors and outliers. Explaining how using the FIP codes with the data you had. Liked the presenation order of explanation.

What were aspects of the presentations for which you had concerns or questions: 
Felt heavy/confusing. Could be due to some of the visualizations, was hard to see quickly what you were trying to explain.




Title of presentation: Yelp (4)

What were aspects of the presentation that you liked: 
Great outputs, visuals, and explantations of how you got analysis details

What were aspects of the presentations for which you had concerns or questions: 
If it was relatively simple, I think comparing to another location would help prove your point. It feels like there was no "answer".




Title of presentation: Chicago Crime (5)

What were aspects of the presentation that you liked: 
Having so many different datasets and variables to make your point is impressive. As well as your visuals and outputs. I could tell you really know what your study is targetted towards.

What were aspects of the presentations for which you had concerns or questions: 
Maybe put or explain the conclusion of each of your plots of analysis, instead of just showing the data.





Title of presentation: Game (6)

What were aspects of the presentation that you liked: 
Great visualizations for audience. Easy to read and understand. Sounded very prepared.

What were aspects of the presentations for which you had concerns or questions: 
Prediction is not clear to me. Even after discussion





Title of presentation: H1B (7)

What were aspects of the presentation that you liked: 
Had very pointed question and problem to solve.

What were aspects of the presentations for which you had concerns or questions: 
Would it be helpful to look at some STEM companies that are located in other places even if not very "dense"? Such as Texas. Just to see what it looks like in comparison.





Title of presentation: Traffic (8)

What were aspects of the presentation that you liked: 
Simple (good and bad), and to the point. Argued your point well.

What were aspects of the presentations for which you had concerns or questions: 
Could you have used some other models besides regression? Feels almost "too" simple.




Title of presentation:  Songs (9)

What were aspects of the presentation that you liked: 
Thought through your word search choices well. Interesting subject.

What were aspects of the presentations for which you had concerns or questions: 
I am slightly confused with the way you have decided whether a song rhymes or not. Such has how many words? Are they in the same verse? How do you find out if they rhyme? Just spelling?




Title of presentation: NBA (10)

What were aspects of the presentation that you liked: 
I don't know much about NBA so glad you focused on teams and players I am aware of. The maps/visuals are great for understanding.

What were aspects of the presentations for which you had concerns or questions: 
Not sure what you are trying to "see". Seems very descriptive.




Title of presentation:  Terrorism (11)

What were aspects of the presentations for which you had concerns or questions:
